3rd Sunday After Epiphany|2/2/2025|Lord and Master, Who dost accept even the giving of a cup of cold water in Thy Name:  We thank Thee for the many opportunities of service, and beseech Thee to keep us faithful in doing Thy will both small and great, that being found faithful in our calling, though we may be poor, might be made rich in possessing all good things, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen|Mic. 7:18-19, Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity and passeth by the  transgression of the remnant of his heritage?  He retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy.  He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.|342|1 Peter 5: 6-11   Page: 1710|Acts 9: 1-18   Page: 1542|324|Luke 15: 1-32   Page: 1462|God Loves and Values, Even, the Lost|345|page 12|638|longer string of text
